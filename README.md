# Bamboo Trigger Responder

To build the project you need the Atlassian-plugin-SDK: 

https://developer.atlassian.com/docs/getting-started/set-up-the-atlassian-plugin-sdk-and-build-a-project

From there it should be a simple matter of forking this project - And run: 


`atlas-clean`
`atlas-package`

As the plugin originally was intended for my own private use, I have not made any translations or Unit Tests... Also, the plugin is very pragmatic and simple. This, ofcourse, opens up the opportunity to improve at will: So please fork & improve. 

- That would be really nice :) 

Best regards
Torben
